# Portfolio-Beta
This repository provides all the tools needed to calculate the Beta of a portfolio, starting from the daily returns of various securities and their respective market benchmark.

Risk Analysis: This module calculates the daily and annualized standard deviations for all the assets provided in the Assets Returns file. The output is a file containing these standard deviation metrics.

SpecAndSisRisk: Using the Market Returns file, the Assets Returns file, and the previously generated standard_deviation_combined file, this module calculates the Beta of each asset. It also computes and outputs the specific and systematic risk for each asset alongside their respective Betas.

Beta Portfolio: This module calculates the portfolio Beta. If asset weights are not provided in the beta_specific_generic_risks file (generated by the previous module), it assumes an equally weighted portfolio approach. Otherwise, it uses the specified weights to compute the portfolio Beta.
